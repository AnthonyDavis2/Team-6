<h1>Echo</h1>
<p>Global healthcare solutions through the power of sound.</p>
<h2>The Problem:</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems in healthcare is having quick access to a patient's record. When moving, or due to office closings it can sometimes range from difficult to impossible to retrieve your medical records which are critical to ongoing care.</p>
<h2>Our Solution:</h2>
<p>By creating a global solution for patient portals we can provide doctors around the world with instant access to the patient's personal information, medical records, and insurance policies. These records can be collected by simply taking a picture through the app. We will use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank">Google Vision</a> to parse the medical files and store valuable data.</p>
<h2>The Twist:</h2>
<p>Instead of having a traditional patient portal, our objective is to keep user health data private and secure. All records will be encrypted and stored locally on the user's phone. In order to transfer the records from patient to doctor we will leverage <a href="https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js" target="_blank">Quiet.js</a> which will transfer the information in JSON format through a brief ultrasonic soundwave.</p>
<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>With no need for an internet connection Echo would be accessible to users all over the world, including many remote locations.</li>
    <li>Echo is straight forward, as easy as taking a picture and pressing a button. This allows it to be intuitive for even less tech literate users.</li>
